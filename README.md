## The project ðŸš€
The goal of the project is to create a python console program that manages a library's functioning. The users are library adherents and librarians.
- An adherent can borrow items, read his profile and change his personnal data, find an item in the library's stock and get some recommendations.
- A librarian can start or close a loan, give sanctions to adherents, register new items in the database and change existing ones' features.
- An item can be either a book, a movie or an audio record. Each familiy of item has specific and exclusive features.

## What I learned ðŸŒŸ
- Create and structure a complex database with multiple inheritance and rules (UML diagrams)
- Normalize a database to optimize its performance
- Use relationnal and non-relationnal elements (using Json)
- Identify relevant information over data and translate them into SQL requests
- Implement SQL requests in a Python programm with psycopg2
